# Spotify Playlists

A collection of playlists created while I was working at a local bike shop.

- [Gouda Music (Mechanic's Version)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/18ARYeeJLUwRAiMLkL3BlQ?si=e976e9ca5f994636)
  - We're super proud of this one. Any time we found a particularly cheesy song, it got added to this playlist. Mostly Asian ballads-- the kind of stuff that all your uncles and aunties sung at the KTV clubs and never told you about.
- [mods asleep, play weird stuff](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/017WWBraz90uSo9HLMgRt9?si=2619d97d2d90416c)
  - Taiwanese metal, Taiwanese math rock, etc etc.
- [plausible anime opening tracks (Mechanic's Version)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3cZDLssy0i8OO31ApAdOcW?si=399372c72d754e84)
  - Self-explanatory, we hope.
- [please don't make me diagnose a bottom bracket over the phone](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2WMoXi26VA8qvDgYVxtNEE?si=156b23bbf4974144)
  - The dumping ground for a bunch of cool Taiwanese music I found for like, 3 months.
- [chill wrench songs (Mechanic's Version)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6gp7TsqC0zFhxycOoMTz7J?si=2ef5bf12c7654056)
  - more relaxing stuff. It's mostly Taiwanese indie music.
